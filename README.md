# Email Automation Project

This project is aimed at automating the process of email summarization, storage, PDF generation, and REST API interaction using Python, OpenAI GPT-2, MongoDB, FastAPI, and other relevant libraries.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **emails/**: Contains modules for email retrieval and summarization.
- **database/**: Modules for database interaction and data models.
- **pdf_generation/**: Modules for generating PDFs and uploading to Cloudinary.
- **scheduling/**: Modules for handling scheduled operations.
- **api/**: FastAPI application and endpoints.
- **config.py**: Configuration file for settings and API keys.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-automation-project.git
cd email-automation-project
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure API keys and settings in `.env`.

4. Start the FastAPI application:

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

5. Run the scheduler for automated tasks:

```bash
python scheduling/scheduler.py
```

## Usage

- The FastAPI application runs on `http://localhost:8000` by default.
- Use API endpoints to interact with email data: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- The scheduler handles automated tasks like fetching emails, summarization, PDF generation, and Cloudinary upload.
